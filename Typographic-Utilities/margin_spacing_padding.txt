Reference for margin spacing and padding
These classes are important for project

-  <h1 class="mb-0 bg-success"> 0 </h1> for creating between the line spacing. that is the spacing between the consequetive html elements
    more the no of mb, higher is the no of spacing between the ssuccesive html elements
    0 to 5
    m stands for margin and p stands for padding 
    with each m and p we have the following combinations
    t- top 
    b- bottom
    l-left
    x- both left and right 
    r-right
    y-both top and bottom (keeps sspace as per as the count between 0 to 5 between the paragraphs)

    for margin do class="m-5" so that it has 5 in top bottom left and right


    Padding is used for dilation
    same mechanish as margin but inverse operation

    mx-auto for horizontal centering
